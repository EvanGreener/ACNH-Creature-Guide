The app was primarily designed for mobile users.

##Usage

The app displays a list of all the obtainable fish, bugs and deep sea creatures depending on your region/hemisphere currently availible in real time. If the viewport width is smaller than 600px (vertical orientation on mobile devices), the table shows the creatures name, sale price and how you can obtain it. Otherwise it will also show the creauture's shadow size (if it has one) and the time interval of when its available.

If you press the filter button, a dialog box will appear with dropdown menus and a toggle. The first dropdown lets you choose your region/hemisphere in your animal crossing world (i.e. North or South). The default is north. The next one allows you to specify which types of creatures you only want to see (i.e. bugs, fish, deep sea or all 3 types). The default is all. The next one allows you to sort the list by price, name, location or no sort. The default is by price. The toggle allows you to filter out the creatures which are available all day so you only see the creatures that are only availible at specific times during the day.
